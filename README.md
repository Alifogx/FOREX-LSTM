# FOREX-LSTM

hello to all
This is the bokeh notebook that I published in Kaggle and now I put it on my GitHub.
In this notebook, I used my data set that I got from Metatrader.
i used a nn that have lstm layer . its very simple . if we use conv layer or embedding layer, its must be better and accurate.
